# These are my preferred priorities if I am ever pinged. these do not apply when @everyone or @here is used!
## You may **ping** me if!
* You need specifically my help
* You reply to add and or comment to a conversation/thread
## You may **DM** me if!
* You need my help and can't ask publically
* You need to clear up details in private
* You send me a server invite in which I ask for you to send

### If you need more clarification on what I prefer, just ping me! (Don't do that just use common sense and ask in general chat or ask me if you need to dm!)
