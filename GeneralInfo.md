# General Info
* I am most commonly known for making Minecraft TASes (Tool Assisted Speedruns)
* I enjoy TASes of a lot of games, but I mainly focus on TASes for the mainline 3D Mario games, Majora's Mask TASes, and the Smash Bros. Series
* I live in California (Pacific Daylight Time = UTC-7:00, Pacific Standard Time = UTC-8:00) so keep my time in mind whenever asking for something!
