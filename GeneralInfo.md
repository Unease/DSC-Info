# General Info
* I am most commonly known for making Minecraft TASes (Tool Assisted Speedruns). I'm most active in the Minecraft TAS server so if you need something related to that, join here! https://discord.gg/jGhNxpd
* I enjoy TASes of a lot of games, but I mainly focus on TASes for the mainline 3D Mario games, Majora's Mask TASes, and the Smash Bros. Series.
* I enjoy RTA speedruns most commonly of the same games I watch TASes of except for Minecraft.
* I live in California (Pacific Daylight Time = UTC-7:00, Pacific Standard Time = UTC-8:00) so keep my time in mind whenever asking for something!
